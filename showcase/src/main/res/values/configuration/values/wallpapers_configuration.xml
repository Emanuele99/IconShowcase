    Do you want to use high definition wallpapers?
    (the difference between -medium- and -high- definition is pretty minimal.
    use high definition if your wallpapers have transparency stuff.
    medium definition will make pictures load faster.
    high definition will make pictures load slower, and increase cache size, and memory (ram) usage.
